# Analogue vs Digital Signals

.left-column[
- Analogue signals are continuous in both time and amplitude
 - Often sensitive to noise
 - Most physical signals are analogue
 - Most electrical sensors produce analogue electrical signals
 - Can be converted to a digital signal via an analogue to digital converter (ADC)
- Digital signals are discrete in both time and amplitude
 - More resistant to noise
 - Cannot exactly reproduce analogue signals
 - Some electrical sensors can output a digital signal
 - Can be converted to an analogue signal via a digital to analogue converter (DAC)

# Sensors and Actuators 


- Often the physical signals/quantities we wish to interact with are not electrical
 - For example, temperature, light, force, torque, etc.
- An electrical transducer converts a physical signal/quantity into an electrical signal or an electrical signal into a physical signal/quantity
 - Can be categorized as electrical sensors and electrical actuators 
- Electrical sensors receive a signal from a physical system, and produce an electrical signal as an output
 - For example, a temperature sensor concerts temperature into an electrical signal (voltage)
- Electrical actuators receive an electrical signal as an input, and produce a physical signal as an output
 - For example, a DC motor converts an electrical signal (current) into mechanical torque

# Processing Signals 

- Originally almost all electronics performed analogue signal processing
 - Used standard components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors
- Analogue signal processing is often complicated
 - Usually requires custom hardware
 - Designing analogue signal processing circuitry takes time and therefore is expensive
- Specialized application, like fail-safe systems, require analogue signal processing
- For many general applications it is beneficial to move the processing onto a digital platform like a microcontroller
 - Multiple different signal processing operations can be performed by the same hardware
 - It is easy to modify the processing by modifying the code 
- Since most real-world signals are analogue, we must convert them into digital signals before we can process them using a microcontroller
 - When converting analogue signals to digital signals we lose some information

# Signals in Your Project

.center[<img src="img/System.png" height="200">]

- The smart energy monitor needs to measure voltage and current to determine power drawn by the load
- Voltage and current are analogue electrical signals and therefore they need to be converted into digital signals in order to use your microcontroller to perform signal processing
- We will use the ADC peripheral on the ATmega328P to convert analogue electrical signals to digital signals
 - The ADC only accepts analogue voltage signals that are in the range between 0V and VCC (e.g. 5V)
 - Because of this you designed circuitry to convert the voltage and current you wish to measure into two analogue voltage signals that falls within this range

# Analogue to Digital Conversion

- An analogue to digital converter (ADC) converts an analogue signal to a digital one
- We know that an analogue signal is continuous in both time and amplitude, whereas a digital signal is not
- Therefore, the analogue signal needs to be digitized/discretized  
 - A process known as sampling is used to convert the analogue signal into discrete time steps
 - A process known as quantization is used to convert the analogue into discrete amplitudes
- The analogue to digital conversion process introduce error
 - For example during quantization information is lost

.center[<img src="img/ADCProcess.png" height="180">]

---
name: S7

# The Sampling Process

- The size of the time intervals the signal is split into, referred to as sample time, is dependent on the sampling frequency (also called sampling rate), measured in hertz
\\[ t\_{sample} = \frac{1}{f\_{sample}} \\]
- Higher sampling rates allow the original analogue signal to be captured more accurately
 - However this requires faster ADC hardware, and more memory to store the digital data
- To accurately capture a signal the sampling rate must be greater than the Nyquist frequency
 - Nyquist frequency is equal to twice the highest frequency present in the signal

---
name: S8

# The Quantization Process

- The full voltage range is broken into discrete levels
- The number of number of bits available in an ADC to represent the amplitude of a signal determine the number of discrete voltage levels, and the number of levels is simply given by 2<sup>bits</sup>
- As example, lets consider an ADC with a full voltage range of 5V and examine how it will represent a 3.2V analogue signal if this ADC had 1-bit, 2-bits and 3-bits to represent an analogue signal

# Characteristics of an ADC

Acquisition Time
How long it takes for the ADC hardware to acquire the signal to be measured. This includes switching multiplexers, charging internal capacitors, waiting for transients to settle etc
Conversion Time
Time taken by the ADC to convert the analogue input signal into a digital output signal
Total Sampling Time
This is the sum of both the acquisition time and conversion time
The maximum sampling rate is limited by the total sampling time
𝑓_(𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝑚𝑎𝑥))=1/(𝑡_(𝑎𝑐𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑚𝑖𝑛))+𝑡_(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑚𝑖𝑛)) )

# UART Waveforms (PI)

.center[<img src="img/UARTWaveform.png" height="310">]

- A UART “frame” or “packet” composes of a start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
 - Bits are represented by voltage levels VCC (for logic "1") and 0V (for logic "0")
 - Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first

name: S14

# UART Baud Rate

.center[<img src="img/UARTUBRR.png" height="230">]

- The amount of time between each bit being transmitted is determined by the baud rate
\\[ \text{Time per Bit} = \frac{1}{\text{Baud Rate}} \\]
- Standard baud rates are 4800, 9600, 19200 etc.
 - Technically you can use any baud rate but not all are supported by a given devices

---
name: S15

# Baud Rate vs Data Rate

- The time taken to send one bit is set by the baud rate
- The total number of bits sent per frame include the start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
- As an example, consider an 8N1 with no parity scheme 
 - The UART frame would consist of 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit 
 - Therefore, we would need to send 10 bits per frame of which only 8 are data bits
- The data rate in bits per second (bps) when using UART communication is therefore
\\[ \text{Data Rate} = \frac{\text{Data Bits per Frame}}{\text{Total Bits per Frame}} \times \text{Baud Rate} \\]
- The time taken to transmit a certain number of data bits is therefore
\\[ \text{Transmission Time} = \frac{\text{Data Bits to Transmit}}{\text{Data Rate}} \\]

- The HM10 BLE module used in the project only accepts 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
- The UART on the ATmega328P should therefore also use 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
- The terminal program running on PC should also be configured to use 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
 - The USB module uses an FTDI IC to convert the UART transmission to a USB transmission that is sent over to the PC and decoded to recover the UART transmission

# UDR0 Register

.center[<img src="img/UDR0.png" width="600">]

- The transmit data buffer (TXB) and receive data buffer (RXB) registers share the same address
 - The register accessed depends on whether a read or write is executed by the code
- When setup to transmit data 
 - The code loads the data byte to transmit into the TXB register through UDR0
 - When the transmit shift register is empty the data in TXB register will be loaded automatically into the transmit shift register 
 - Each bit in the transmit shift register will be automatically transmitted one at a time as [we learnt previously](#S10)
- When setup to receive data
 - Once the receive shift register receive a data byte, it is automatically copied into the RXB register

.center[<img src="img/UARTClock.png" width="500">]

- The UBRR0 value defines the prescaler applied to used to the system clock (f<sub>osc</sub>) to obtain the UART clock (i.e. UART clock = (f<sub>osc</sub> / (UBRR0 + 1))
- Under normal operation the UART clock needs to be 16 times the baud rate and therefore
\\[ \text{Baud Rate} = \frac{f\_{osc}} {16 \times \left( UBRR0 + 1 \right) } \quad \text {or} \quad UBRR0 = \frac {f\_{osc}} {\left( \text {Baud Rate} \right) \times 16}  - 1\\]

# Configuring the UART

- First we need to configure the UART as per our specifications (9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity)
 - Need to set the bits of the [UCSR0A](#S24), [UCSR0B](#S25), [UCSR0C](#S26) and [UBRR0](#S27) registers 
 - Have to configure the bits of the DDRD register associated with TX and RX pins (done by default)
 - Do this in an initialization function

.codes[
```c
// This function configures the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
void uart_init(uint32_t baud_rate){
  UCSR0A = 0b00000000;    //None of the settings here are used
  UCSR0B = 0b00001000;    //Set TXEN0 bit to 1 (enable transmit) and UCSZ02 bit to 0 (8 data bits)
                          //To improve readability we should aim to write this in the form "UCSR0B = (1<<TXEN0);"
  UCSR0C = 0b00000110;    //UMSEL0[1..0]=00 (UART mode), UPM0[1..0]=00 (no parity), 
                          //USBS0=0 (1 stop-bit), UCSZ0[1..0]=11 (8 data bits)
  UBRR0 = 16000000 / (16 * baud_rate) - 1;
                          //Set UBRR0 as per baud rate formula
}
```

# Transmitting a Data Byte

- We also know how to use the UART registers to transmit data
 - We send data by loading the data byte to be sent into the UDR0 register
 - UDR0 needs to be ready for the new data byte and this can be checked by making sure the UDRE0 bit in the UCSR0A register is set
 - We typically do the above in a function dedicated to transmitting a byte

.codes[
```c
// This function transmits a single byte via the UART
void uart_transmit_byte(char byte){	
  while ((UCSR0A & 0b00100000) == 0){       //UDRE0 bit is checked to see if it is 0 
  ;                                         //If UDRE0 bit is not 0, wait until it becomes 0	
  }

  //Put the byte to be sent into the UDR0 register
  UDR0 = byte;
}
```
]

# Transmitting an Array of Bytes

- We can also write a function that can transmit an array of bytes 
 - In a loop, we need to transmit one byte at a time by calling the function we wrote to transmit a byte
 - The number of bytes in the array is determined using the method *strlen* 
 - To use *strlen* you need to **#include &lt; string.h &gt;**

.codes[
```c
//This function transmits an array of bytes via the UART using uart_transmit_byte(char byte)function
void uart_transmit_array(char* msg){
	//Loop through each byte in the array 
	for (uint8_t i = 0; i < strlen(msg); i++){		
		uart_transmit_byte(msg[i]);				//Transmit each byte using uart_transmit_byte(char byte)
	}	
}
```

# Why Do We Need Character Encoding?

- UART communication protocol allows us to successfully transfer data between a microcontroller and external devices
 - UART can send a single byte of data at a time
- If we only want to send numbers between 0-255 (or -128 to 127) then this works, but what if we want to send other data types?
 - For example how to send alphanumeric characters, larger numbers, key-value pairs, etc.
- We call these desired values our “character set”
- Encoding determines how our character set is represented by the data we can send
- There are many types of character encoding systems
 - ASCII, ANSI, Unicode and UTF are a few common encoding systems
- ASCII maps letters (upper and lower case), numbers (0-9), and special characters, to the range 0-127
 - For example, 0x48 is used to represent the character ‘A’

# Completing the UART Code

.codes[
```c
#define F_CPU 16000000UL                    //Defining system clock frequency

#include <avr/io.h>                         //Needed for using the macros for register addresses
#include <string.h>                         //Needed for using strlen()
#include "util/delay.h"                     //Needed for using _delay_ms()

//Prototypes of functions used
void uart_init(uint32_t baud_rate);     
void uart_transmit_byte(char byte);
void uart_transmit_array(char* msg);

int main(void){

  uart_init(9600);                          //Initializing the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1, with no parity

  while (1){
    uart_transmit_byte(0x48);               //Transmitting character 'H' - alternatively uart_transmit_byte('A');
    uart_transmit_array("ello World\n\r");  //Transmitting string "ello World" with newline character '\n'
                                            //and carriage return character '\r'
    _delay_ms(1000);                        //Transmit above characters every 1s
  }
}

# Using *printf* and *sprintf* (PI)

- The *printf* and *sprintf* commands uses ASCII encoding
 - These commands take an input string, format it, and output it
- To use *printf* and *sprintf* **#include &lt; stdio.h &gt;** 
- We also need to redirect the output of *printf* to use the UART and to do this we bind a function which transmits a character via the UART

.codes[
```c
//Creating a stream variable
static FILE usart_stdout = FDEV_SETUP_STREAM(uart_printf, NULL, _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE);

int main(void)
{
  stdout = &usart_stdout;         //Binding the steam variable to stdout	
  uart_init(9600);                //Initializing the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
  
  while (1){
    printf("Hello World\r\n");    //Printing "Hello World"
    _delay_ms(1000);              //Transmit message every 1s
  }
}
```

# Using *printf* and *sprintf* (PII)

- To use *printf* we need a new function called *uart_printf*

.codes[
```c
int uart_printf(char var, FILE *stream) {
	uart_transmit_byte(var);      //Using our original function to transmit UART data
	return 0;
}
```
]

- Both *printf* and *sprintf* take a format string which defines the output together with a set of arguments
- Format specifiers stating with % sign tell where to put these arguments and how to format them

.codes[
```c
printf("Color %s, Number %d, Hex %X","Red", 125, 125);
```
]

- When using sprintf the output is written into a character array
 - An example of using *sprintf* is provided in the UART lab
- The main drawback of using *printf* and *sprintf* is the overhead they add in a very resource limited environment

# Developing Modular Software

- At this stage you should be learning to develop modular software
 - For example, all code relating each peripheral can be in a separate .c file, with a corresponding .h file
 - Allows code reuse, manageable and readable code, easy to collaborate, easy to test and validate
- As an example, lets consider the code developed to use the UART
 - Use a separate C source file called *uart.c* and a corresponding header file called *uart.h*, which will hold function prototypes for all functions in *uart.c*
 - The *uart.h* should **#include** as few other .h files as possible and it should be protected against multiple **#include**
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *uart.c* together with any necessary .h files
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *main.c* so that we can access our UART functions
- You may also want a shared .h such as *common.h* for global **#define** for example **#define F_CPU**
 - Avoid sharing global variables between .c files by declaring them as *static*

# Things To Note

- Your transmit function is blocking and your MCU cannot do anything else while transmitting over the UART
 - It can interfere with code that has timing constraints
 - DO NOT use UART transmissions from within time critical tasks like interrupts
- You must understand examples you use during the lab
 - Your individual understanding will be assessed during all assessments 
 - During 2nd test you will have to develop a C program yourself and simulate it on Proteus
 - All team members must therefore understand every part of the design
- It is critical that you complete the pre-lab of the UART lab before your lab session so that you can get help with the later parts of the lab
 - Please do not waste the opportunity to get support in the labs 
 - With 160 students in the class, closer to due dates, there will be limited opportunities to ask for help 
- You need to demonstrate UART transmission during your midsemester review
